CyberStart
1) https://cyberstart.com/ its a bit costly, but its super helpful. Gives you the basics for understanding a ton of cyber aspects
2) 
3) if you dont already have one, get a raspberry pi, and check out https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS/ to get an idea of something you could make. The same goes for arduinos! I highly recommend making a pwnagotchi (wifi hacking tool with a rpi) https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnagotchi/
4) DC labs helped me learn a LOT. Heres a link to a walkthrough and a VM download, though I recommend doing cyberstart first.
